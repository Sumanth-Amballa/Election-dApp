# Election dApp

**Decentralized Application for Election Poll**

This project is a basic decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to participate in a simple election poll using blockchain technology. It demonstrates the integration of smart contracts with a web-based frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity** – Smart contract development
- **JavaScript** – Web3 interaction and client-side scripting
- **HTML** – Structure of the web application
- **CSS** – Styling the application
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive design and UI components
- **Blockchain** – Decentralized backend using Ethereum
- **MetaMask** – Ethereum wallet and blockchain gateway for users

## Overview

- Smart contract written in Solidity to manage candidates and votes.
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
- Connects to the blockchain using Web3.js.
- Allows users to cast a vote securely and view the voting results.

## How to Run

1. Compile and deploy the smart contract using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
2. Connect the frontend to the deployed contract using Web3.js.
3. Open the web page to interact with the election dApp through MetaMask or a similar Ethereum wallet.

## Features
